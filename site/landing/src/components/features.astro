        Camblet, a bespoke solution designed specifically for securing internal
        workload communication, effectively implements the zero trust model of
        "never trust, always verify". It safeguards against insider threats and
        prevents lateral movements during breaches.<br />By automatically
        authenticating and encrypting traffic through mutual TLS, and enforcing
        custom access control policies set by administrators, Camblet ensures a
        secure and controlled network environment.
