## Community support

If you encounter problems while using Nasp that the documentation does not address, [open an issue](https://github.com/naspio/) in the repository of the relevant component, or talk to us in the [#nasp channel of the Outshift Community Slack](https://outshift.com/slack).

Before reporting a new issue, please ensure that the issue was not already reported or fixed by searching through our issue tracker.

When creating a new issue, please be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as
possible, and, if possible, a test case.

**If you discover a security bug, please do not report it through GitHub issues. Instead, please follow the steps in [Security procedures](/docs/security).**
