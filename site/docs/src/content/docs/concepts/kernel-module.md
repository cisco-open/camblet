title: Kernel module
---

The kernel module is capable of enhancing plain old TCP sockets in a frictionless way so that application developers can focus on their business logic instead of dealing with the complexity of TLS, mTLS, authentication, authorization and other security-related concerns. It is doing this seamlessly, no code changes or re-compilations or re-deployments are required for applications, let it be in-house or third-party products.
