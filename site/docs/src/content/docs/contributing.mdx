Thanks for your interest in contributing to Nasp!

Here are a few general guidelines on contributing and reporting bugs that we ask you to review and follow.

Please note that all of your interactions in the project are subject to our [Code of Conduct](/docs/code-of-conduct). This
includes creation of issues or pull requests, commenting on issues or pull requests, and extends to all interactions in
any real-time space e.g., Slack, etc.

Submitting pull requests and code changes is not the only way to contribute:

- If you use Nasp in a production environment, add yourself to the [adopters list](https://github.com/naspio/nasp/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md).
- Help new users with issues they may encounter on the GitHub Issues pages of our repositories
- Participate in discussions in the [#nasp community Slack channel](https://outshift.com/slack) or in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/naspio/discussions)
- Support the development of this project and [star our GitHub repos](https://github.com/naspio)!
- Report bugs or request features in [GitHub repos](https://github.com/naspio)
- Review and update the existing content of our [documentation](https://nasp.io/docs) with up-to-date instructions and code samples

## Reporting issues

Before reporting a new issue, please ensure that the issue was not already reported or fixed by searching through our issue tracker.

When creating a new issue, please be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and, if possible, a test case.

If you discover a security bug, please do not report it through GitHub issues. Instead, please follow the steps in [Security procedures](https://naspio.docs/security).

## Sending pull requests

Before sending a new pull request, take a look at existing pull requests and issues to see if the proposed change or fix
has been discussed in the past, or if the change was already implemented but not yet released.

Make sure to [sign-off your commits](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff): `Signed-off-by: your name <youremail@address.com>`

We expect new pull requests to include tests for any affected behavior, and, as we follow semantic versioning, we may
reserve breaking changes until the next major version release.
